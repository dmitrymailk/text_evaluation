Requirements:
------------

To build METEOR:

Java JDK 1.5 or above:
http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp

Apache Ant:
http://ant.apache.org/

To include TERp paraphrase information:

Python 2.6:
http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.6.2/


Building METEOR:
---------------

METEOR can use portions of the TERp (http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/~snover/terp)
paraphrase database to improve match recall.  This is required for the HTER task
to work properly.  To include this functionality in a METEOR build, download the
database (http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/~snover/terp/downloads/terp-pt.v1.tgz) and
extract the files.  Use the create_paraphrase_file script to build the file used
by METEOR.  Assuming the METEOR directory and database directory of terp-pt.v1
are in the same parent diretory, run the following:

$ cd meteor-*
$ ./scripts/create_paraphrase_file.py . ../terp-pt.v1/unfiltered_phrasetable.txt

When this is finished, run ant from the METEOR directory (containing the file
"build.xml"):

$ ant

This will create a METEOR distribution in the "dist" directory including the
METEOR jar file and documentation.  The distribution can be moved or copied to
other systems.


Testing the build:
-----------------

To test the METEOR source build, verify the that scores for an example
test set match the included precalculated scores:

$ cd dist/meteor-*
$ java -jar meteor.jar example/test.sgm example/ref.sgm -sgml
$ diff *seg.score example/*seg.score
$ diff *doc.score example/*doc.score
$ diff *sys.score example/*sys.score
